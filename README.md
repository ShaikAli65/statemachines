# Statemachines

A library that implements text book concepts of Theory of Computation.

I tried coding up the algorithms and ideas of

1. Deterministic Finite Automata (aka D.F.A)
2. Non-Deterministic Finite Automata (N.F.A)
3. Push-Down Automata (P.D.A)
4. Turing Machine

_Thats all they taught ;\)_

## Folders

`scratch` folder contains my first attempt of implementing things. This is getting re-organised into proper library
style structure and I am working with C++ name spaces and learning how libraries are written.

## What's done

1. NFA & DFA state structures
2. NFA & DFA statemachines
3. Transforming NFA to DFA
4. Running a statemachine to validate a string pattern

## To Be Done

1. Push Down Automata
2. A simple Turing machine impl.
3. Learn Building A.S.T from a grammer
